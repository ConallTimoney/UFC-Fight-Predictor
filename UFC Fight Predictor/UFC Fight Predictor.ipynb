    "# Predicting the winner of UFC fights \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a machine learing model that predicts the winner of ufc fights. UFC fights are incredibly hard to predict, fighters only tend to fight eachother if they are seen ass being about as good as each other, fighters rarely if ever fight someone they are confident they can beat unlike in boxing. This makes predicting the out come of UFC fights very difficult to predict. The UFC places the favoured fighter or the champion of the weight division in the red corner, they are right about the victor only 57% of time. Below is a description of the data that came with the data, which cam be found at https://www.kaggle.com/rajeevw/ufcdata. Unfortunately a lot of the data has been recorded/scraped incorrectly, the first one thousand fights all have the red corner winning. Most people who have used this data set on kaggle did not notice this as result there models could achieve an accuracy of 67% by just guessing Red wins every time.\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "This is a list of every UFC fight in the history of the organisation. Every row contains information about both fighters, fight details and the winner. The data was scraped from ufcstats website. After fightmetric ceased to exist, this came into picture. I saw that there was a lot of information on the website about every fight and every event and there were no existing ways of capturing all this. I used beautifulsoup to scrape the data and pandas to process it. It was a long and arduous process, please forgive any mistakes. I have provided the raw files in case anybody wants to process it differently. This is my first time creating a dataset, any suggestions and corrections are welcome! In case anyone wants to check out the work, I have all uploaded all the code files, including the scraping module here\n",

    "### Content\n",
    "Each row is a compilation of both fighter stats. Fighters are represented by 'red' and 'blue' (for red and blue corner). So for instance, red fighter has the complied average stats of all the fights except the current one. The stats include damage done by the red fighter on the opponent and the damage done by the opponent on the fighter (represented by 'opp' in the columns) in all the fights this particular red fighter has had, except this one as it has not occured yet (in the data). Same information exists for blue fighter. The target variable is 'Winner' which is the only column that tells you what happened. Here are some column definitions:\n",

    "* **Probability of landing a significant strike**. This will be the number of significant strikes a fighter has landed over the number they have thrown.\n",
    "* **Significant strike rate.** The rate at which a fighter attempts to land significant strikes. Preferably per second but could be given per round if necessary.\n",
    "* **Probability of landing a strike**\n",
    "* **Strike Rate**\n",
    "* **Probability of landing a takedown.** A takedown is where one fighter wrestles the other fighter to the ground.\n",
    "* **Takedown attempt rate.**\n",
    "* **Takedown,Significant Strike and Strike defence probability**. The probability of defending the attack method based on historical fights.  \n",
    "* **Knock down rate**. A knock down is when one fighter knocks anther one down with a strike. \n",
    "* **Win probability**\n",
    "* **total number of fights**\n",
    "* **Age**\n",
    "* **How many title bouts the fighter has been in**\n",
    "* **Network Centrality.** A network will be constructed using networkx and the an eigenvector centrality score score will be calculated for every fighter, we will start with katz centrality but may use some others later like PageRank. We will begin with creating a network for all the fighters and one for each weight class. For a fight we will consider each fighters score for the network of all fighters and their score in the weight class of the fights. \n",
    "* **Finnish rate**. In MMA finishing an opponent is when one fighter knocks out or taps out an opponent. Clearly a fighter has knocked out every opponent they have faced in the first round they are good fighter. This feature will be number of finishes over total fight time.\n",
    "* **Current loss streak**\n",
    "* **Current win streak** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For training and testing it makes sense to split the fights chronologically rather than randomly. Training the algorithms on the oldest fights and testing them on more recent ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some other features we may include later are:\n",
    "* **Reach difference**  A fighters reach is the distance between their fingertips when they hold the arms apart and parallel to the ground. Reach can approximate the distance a fighter can punch at.  \n",
    "* **Height difference** Will give and indication who is punching with and who is punching against gravity. \n",
